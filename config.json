But first, we need to make sure you're not a lost tourist, a wandering sandstorm, or someone who thinks hummus is just a snack (it's a way of life here). ???????\n\nWhat do we need from you??\nA screenshot of your in-game passport (yes, even if you're just here for the vibes).?\nOur Tourist centre will check your request faster than you can say \"Yalla, let's go!\" But remember: \"Al-sabr miftah al-farah\" (Patience is the key to joy... and entry).?\nMay your stay be as smooth as our coffee, and your memes as valuable as our oil. \n\nShukran!?",
